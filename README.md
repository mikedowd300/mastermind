# mastermind
A recreation of the board game Mastermind, a game of logic.

I finally made a repo for this. Mastermind was the very first app I wrote after I learned HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and jQuery. I was tempted to refactor my code but decided to leave it as is as an example 
of what I was able to accomplish with nothing but a little bit of treehouse.com.
